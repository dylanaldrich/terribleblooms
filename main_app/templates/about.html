                Tear open the warm belly of earth, plant a few seeds, or lay a bulb<br>
                and let’s see what human nature spews into the day,<br>
                or births sobbing into evening.<br><br>

                All it takes is a few minutes, and<br>
                seeds deprived of air and light,<br>
                then drowned and left below ground.<br><br>

                Only faintest warmth for comfort<br>
                in the cold hopeful bed<br>
                Ah Life, your garden reveals some awful secrets<br>
                and yields some Terrible Blooms.

                    <span id="tagline">A Garden of Terrible Blooms</span> is a passion project created by Sharon Yablon and Thomas Chan. Thomas has provided sound design and live music for two of Sharon’s themed, one-act productions: <span class="play-title">Stomach Contents</span> (Zombie Joe’s Underground Theater, 2018), which was set in the desert, and <span class="play-title">24 Hours On Sunset</span> (indoor and outdoor locations, 2011), which was an evening of one-acts centered around the iconic Sunset Boulevard. They have also worked together on individual plays and performances over the years in a variety of locations.
